      <h4>The workroom</h4>
      <p>
        This area of the Site is for the benefit of Users. The private and
        shared Workroom areas of the Site facilitate communication and the
        exchange and sharing of information between Consumers and Contractors
        once a bid has been accepted. The information contained in private
        Workrooms shared between Consumers and Contractors is not used for any

      </p>
      <h4>Information we gather</h4>
      <h4>Registration</h4>
      <p>
        If you register to buy or sell services using Auction.io, we collect and
        store Personal Information that specifically identifies you or your
        Account. The information you would be required to submit is your first
        name, last name, User ID, password, street address, city, state,
        zip/postal code, country, phone number, email address and valid
        financial account information. Other information requested on our

        from Auction.io, is optional. We may, in the future, include other
        optional requests for information from you to help us to tailor the Site
        for you and deliver personalized information to you. Without your
        agreement, we will not share, rent or sell any Personal Information with
        third parties in any way other than what is disclosed in this Privacy
        Policy. In addition, to post a first-time Service Request, Auction.io
        requires registered Users to pay an activation fee via and consequently
        we might collect your credit card number and/or other financial account
        information. Credit card information is transmitted via SSL (“Secure
        Socket Layer”) encryption for your protection.
      </p>
      <h4>Payments</h4>
      <p>
        Registered Users who purchase Site Services are required to pay with a
        credit card, wire transfer, ACH or debit card, check, or PayPal.
        Consequently, Auction.io will collect your credit card number and/or
        other entered financial institution information such as bank account
        numbers or PayPal email ID and will use that information to perform the
        billing operation, including but not limited to the use and disclosure
        of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary
        to complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information,
        however, is accomplished solely by the User through the authentication
        process.
      </p>
      <h4>Third Party Service Providers and Agents</h4>
      <p>
        We use credit card and other payment processing companies to bill you
        for goods and services and email marketing companies to send emails from
        Auction.io to opt-in users. We will share your Personal Information as
        necessary for third parties to provide these services. These companies
        do not retain, share, store or use Personal Information for any other
        purposes.
      </p>
      <h4>Automatically Gathered Information</h4>
      <p>
        Auction.io automatically collects browser type and browser software
        version to tailor the presentation of the Site and the Site Services to
        Users and to maintain a record of the User’s activity on the Site. As an
        automatic process, our Web server software records a log file of IP
        addresses that access the Site. We also collect IP address information
        but do not ordinarily link IP addresses to Users’ Personal Information.
        However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we, in
        our sole discretion, determine that it is necessary to enforce
        compliance with our Terms of Service or to protect our service, Site,
        customers or others. When you use the Site, Auction.io collects
        information about your Account transactions and Auction.io may collect
        information about your computer for fraud prevention purposes. Finally,
        Auction.io may collect additional information from or about you in other
        ways not specifically described here. For example, Auction.io may
        collect information related to your contact with Auction.io Customer
        Service or store results when you respond to a survey.
      </p>
      <h4>Cookies</h4>
      <p>
        When you use the Site, Auction.io or our contractors may place small
        data files called cookies on your computer. Auction.io uses cookies to
        enable Users to specify unique preferences and to track visitor and User
        use of the site, including trends and patterns. Auction.io sends a
        session cookie to your computer when you log in to your Account. This

        Auction.io also uses longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as
        to display your project related information. Auction.io encodes our
        cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.
        Users and Visitors always have the option of disabling cookies via their

        order to place bids, you must create a Skill Profile, and in order to
        create a Skill Profile, you will be required to provide some information
