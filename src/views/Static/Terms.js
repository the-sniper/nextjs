      </p>

      <h4>5. Confidentiality</h4>
      <p>
        1.The “Confidential Information” includes, but is not be limited to, any
        and all information associated with a party’s business and not publicly
        known, including specific business information, technical processes and

        processing fees), price lists, and other unpublished financial
        information, business plans and marketing data, and any other
        confidential and proprietary information, whether or not marked as
        confidential or proprietary. Auction.io’s Confidential Information
        includes all information that you receive relating to us, or to the
        Services, that is not known to the general public including information

        <br />
        <br />
        2.Each party agrees to apply the other party’s Confidential Information
        entirely as important for performing its obligations under those Terms
        and conditions of service and according with other obligations in those
        Terms and conditions of service along with this Section 5. Each party
        agrees that it shall take all reasonable steps, at the least extensively
        equivalent to the steps it takes to protect its own proprietary
        statistics, to prevent the duplication, disclosure or use of such a
        Confidential Information, aside from
        <br />
        <br />
        (i) by or to its employees, sellers and subcontractors who must have
        access to such Confidential Information to perform such party’s
        obligations hereunder, who each shall treat such Confidential
        Information as provided herein, and who are each subject to obligations
        of confidentiality to such party that are at least as stringent as those
        contained herein; or <br />
        <br />
        (ii) as required by any law, regulation, or order of any court of proper
        jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter contained in these
        Terms and conditions of service, provided that, if legally allowed, the
        receiving party shall give the disclosing party prompt written notice
        and use commercially reasonable efforts to make certain that such
        disclosure is accorded <br />
        confidential treatment. Confidential Information shall not include any
        information that the receiving party can prove: <br />
        <br />
        (A) was already in the public domain, or was recognised by or in the
        possession of the receiving party, at the time of disclosure of such
        information; <br />
        <br />
        (B) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or
        connection to the other party’s Confidential Information, and with out
        breaching any provisions of these Terms and condition of service; <br />
        <br />
        (C) is therefore rightly received by the receiving party from a source
        other than the disclosing party without breaching any provision of these
        Terms and conditions of service.
